# capston backend 

This is a backend application built with Node.js and MongoDB. It serves as the server-side component of a web application, providing API endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X): [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- MongoDB (version X.X.X): [https://www.mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:


2. Install the dependencies:


3. Configure the environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Specify the following environment variables:
     ```
     DB_CONNECTION=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
     PORT=<port-number>
     ```
   - Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with the connection string for your MongoDB database, and `<port-number>` with the desired port number for the server.

4. Start the application:


5. The server should now be running at `http://localhost:<port-number>`. You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
